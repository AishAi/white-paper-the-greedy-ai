# Milestone Submission

Aish is build on a complex software development environment, yet with an easy to use UI.

Any shareholder may submit milestones at any point in time. Shareholder are encouraged to tag at their best knowledge. This will simplify the process for Aish to sort all incoming proposals by relevance.

If a shareholders submitted milestone get's listed within a category they receive a notification and are rewarded an initialisation fee.

Once Aish's **Milestone Service** determines a milestone to be feasable with the proposed budget the milestone get's approved and moves to in progress in the internal Scrum Board.
