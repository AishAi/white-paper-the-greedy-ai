# Scrum

Aish is using agile workflow and resources to manage the project scope. Aish source being house and maintained with Open Source git repositories this path seems to be most natural taken the circumstances. 

However aim is to introduce specific AI components that at some point are able to take over positions such as scrum masters, and product owners if applicable.

This means, if Aish has no relevant data about a potential milestone, it tries to recruit the proposer of the milestone as product owner and an experience scrum master to deliver that specific product. If Aish comes to the conclusion that it may very well handle the delivery of either part of the process for a milestone, those position ought to be replaced by Aish's internal decision making and control.

Extensions and variations to these processes are boiler plated inside the Aish Core Service's Services and may be extended upon demand.
