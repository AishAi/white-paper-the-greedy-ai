# Aish Panel IoT Host

The moderator of the [AI Summit panel discussion Praha 2nd of December 2017](/public-appearances/ai-summit). This is the preliminary face of _Aish_ to the public. 

## Roadmap

In order to roll out a functioning and stable environment for the panel, the IoT device's development is split into two stages prioritising playback. 

### Stage 1 - Playback

The _Aish Panel IoT Host_ will be able to wait for playback instructions send by the [Aish Panel Client](/technical-documentation/experimental-services/aish-panel-client.md "Aish Panel Client"). It handles the audio playback and light organ.

### Stage 2 - Listen

The _Aish Panel IoT Host_** **will integrate the functionalities of the [Aish Listening Service](/technical-documentation/experimental-services/aish-listening-service.md "Aish Listening Service"). This separation is done due to concerns about the possibilities of audio processing of the device's underlying Intel NUC miniature computer architecture.
