# DAO

To maintain autonomy Aish is based upon a blockchain technology called Ethereum. It's a collection of contracts defined by a programming language called solidity. All decision making and business transactions are outline by rule sets of the DAO and transparently stored as contracts and transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

The DAO is the required as the core initial development of Aish. We mention this concept here merely for development documentation and architecture.

The DAO is open-source and may be open for debate or optimization by third parties.
