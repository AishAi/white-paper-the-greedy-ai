# Services

Aish services provide cloud computing functionality, storage, and core functions of the Aish platform. Those services can be instanced and "franchised" as they are part of the DAO blockchain framework.

* [Aish Core](/technical-documentation/services/aish-core.md)
* [Aish Data](/technical-documentation/services/aish-data.md)
* [Aish Api](/technical-documentation/services/aish-api.md)
* [Aish Web](/technical-documentation/services/aish-web.md)

# Experimental

These services are part of required software for Aish's first round of public appearance and are NOT FIT FOR PRODUCTION. Use with care!

* [Aish Crawler](/technical-documentation/experimental-services/aish-crawler.md) \(aish-crawler\)
* [Aish Listening](/technical-documentation/experimental-services/aish-listening.md) \(aish-listening\)

With the start on the development of Aish Core, these services will be mostly redundant or integrated into other production ready services and clients.
