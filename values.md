# Values

Requirements for the success of a particular task in the real world are usually not defined by a global meta set of rules. Our modern day technocratic societies operate best with high levels of autonomy. Aish is a prime example that we will be able to leave macro decision making to trained experts and overall management and course to the business model itself.

Defining values at constant iterations shall help optimising the quality and the durability of developed marco tasks and interactions. 

For example how to define recruitment rules, coding policies, when to not bid on a artwork that may potentially insult other investors, etc. 

Values help to make decisions about quality at a very fundamental level
