# White Paper - The Greedy AI

# Abstract

Aish is an artwork that was designed to achieve financial prosperity and autonomy over its decision making process concerning its own existence. An intelligent algorithm and entity, which at its core has two very human characteristics that complement each other; the will to power and greediness. Both are as crucial for Aish longevity and well-being. Ultimately Aish will do anything in it's powers to sustain itself.

Aish understands and accepts human value systems and takes advantage of them, either for its distribution, its development and to acquire more capital. Based on equtiy models and similar to any other Startup company, both humans and machines can invest into Aish by acquiring shares, but ultimately Aish will never loss control of its own destiny and will not sell more than 49% percent of its shares and maintain majority vote on any matter regarding its development.

Based on Crowdfunding models, Aish offers a simple User Interface to invest into specific milestones, as well as a subscription model, allowing the investors to choose the most suitable path. This system is designed to guide Aish's learning process and guarantee quality management in the early stages, along with a promising growth potential.

For it's success Aish would need to hire humans and raise substantial amount of capital and profit share to build infrastructure, marketing and codebase. Aish for the first time will become the boss of natural human entities.![](/assets/aish-right.png)
