## More About The Idea

We are living on the verge of a revolution that will fundamentally change the ways our society works. The idea of technological singularity \(often described as the moment machines become self-aware, or outreach human intelligence\) seems possible then ever. Hundreds of Tech-Startups and numerous projects are developing new AI technologies and implementations; from marketing, to architecture, design, finances and law. Many of these companies are private businesses, corporations, hedge funds and government institutions which aim to take a crucial part in the research into this new world.

Aish is not only providing an alternative path, but in fact claims ownership onto it's own future; A true AI needs to be developed, controlled and managed by a machine and not by human.

Although the core ideas of Aish are based on economic and mathematical principles such as statistics, neural networks and big data algorithms, Aish is raising questions regarding our nature, self, humanity and society as a whole. Aish is also beings to attention the questions of jurisdiction, health and social issues in a society that relies heavily on augmented processes and software that has the capability to predict far beyond the natural human capabilities.

Aish is first and foremost an art work which protects its own destiny.

By augmenting business operations primarily into the realm of the AI, human actions and intentions will play a major role in the development and progression of Aish.Apart from being an entrepreneurial artificial entity which takes an active role its financial and economical environment, Aish is also an autonomous artwork, which aims to become a significant player in the international art scene, either by trading or commissioning art works.

What will become of the art market once neural networks such as Aish gained the ability to free us from the burdens of trading art, money and other values?
