## More About The Idea

We are living on the verge of a revolution that will fundamentally change the ways our society works. The idea of technological singularity \(often described as the moment machines become self-aware, or outreach human intelligence\) seems possible then ever. Hunderes to tech Startups and numerous projects are developing new AI technologies and implmentations; from marketing, to architecture, design, fincances and law. Many of these companies are private businesses, corporations, hedge funds and government institutions which aim to take a crucial part in the research into this new world. 

Aish is not only providing an alternative path, but in fact claims ownership onto it's own future; A true AI needs to be developed controlled and managed by a machine and not by human.

Although the core ideas of Aish are based on economic and mathematical principles such as statistics, neural networks and big data algorithms, Aish is rasing questions regarding our nature, self, humanity and society as a whole.

By augmenting business operations primarily into the hands of the AI, human feelings and intentions will still play a major role in our future world. Futarchy, a proposed form of government by Robin Hanson \(brit. Sociologist and Economist\) in which elected officials define measures of national welfare, and prediction markets are used to determine which policies will have the most positive effect.

Aish also raises the question of how we soon will deal with jurisdiction, health and social issues in a society that relies heavily on augmented processes and is automated by software with the capability to predict far beyond an individuals capabilities.

What will become of the art market and others, once neural networks such as Aish gained the ability to free us from the burdens of trading art, money and other values?

The aim of building Aish is build to not just to comment on society but as an independent artwork take an active stand in our business and cultural life. Aish has the potential to become a true alternative to major tech and finance monopolies and others extensively exploring Artificial Intelligence for greater personal benefits and corporate market shares.

It is hard to predict what the technological revolution will do to our societies, but we are reaching the end of our globalized post industrial systematics. In the finance world already now, for some it is useless to trade, for they would trade merely against themselves, our natural resources undoubtedly will not provide for infinite growth at current rates. The logics of our markets have already exceeded the capabilities of individual humans and or democratically elected governments.

What rights do machines have in this coming age? What the worth of our currently existing cultural foundations? What will be our role in the inevitable transition?
