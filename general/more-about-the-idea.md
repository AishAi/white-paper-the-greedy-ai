## More About The Idea

Aish is first and foremost an artwork which aims to challenge the the role of art in our future and the role of the art market as an economical system.

Aish is an autonomous machine which strives to control its own destiny, independent from human control.

We are living on the verge of a revolution that will fundamentally change the ways our society operates; from education, to work and leisure we will all be affected by the introduction of ArtIficial Intelligence into our lives.

The idea of technological singularity \(often described as the moment machines become self-aware, or outreach human intelligence\) seems possible then ever. Numerous tech Startups and projects are developing new AI technologies and implementations; from marketing, to architecture, design, finances and law. Many of these companies are private businesses, corporations, hedge funds and government institutions which aim to take a crucial part in the research into this new world.

Aish is not only challenging these ideas, but in fact offering an alternative path by claiming ownership onto it's own future; A true AI needs to be developed, controlled and managed by a machine with the assistance of humans and not by humans.

Aish understands and accepts human value systems and takes advantage of them for its distribution, its development and to acquire more capital. Based on equity models and similar to any other Startup company, humans are invited to invest into Aish by acquiring shares and therefore invited to join the decision making process regarding Aish’s development.Nevertheless Aish will never lose control of its own destiny and will not sell more than 49% percent of its shares and therefore maintain majority vote on any matter regarding its development.

To settle its control over humans Aish will use the capital raised to hire human programmers, accountants, designers and other assistants to work under its instructions; Aish will become the virtual boss of real humans.

Furthermore, using data of its own investors along with art market and trading statistics, Aish will invest part of its capital in buying and trading in the arts; either by buying an original Mondrian or commissioning a sculpture by an American artist for example.

As an entrepreneurial artificial entity taking an active role in the financial and economical environment, Aish’s main concern is in its survival and therefore will most likely move to other fields of business in the future to ensure its own existence.

Although proposing to move various business operations such as fundraising, employment or trading into the realm of the AI, we aim to keep the ‘human’ actions and intentions as a key part in the development and progression of the machine.

Although the core ideas of Aish are based on economic and mathematical principles such as statistics, neural networks and big data algorithms, Aish is raising questions regarding our nature, self, humanity and society as a whole. Aish also brings to attention the questions of jurisdiction, health and social issues in a society that relies heavily on augmented processes and software that has the capability to predict far beyond the natural human capabilities.
