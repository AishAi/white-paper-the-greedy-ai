## More About The Idea

We are living on the verge of a revolution that will fundamentally change the ways our society works. The idea of technological singularity \(often described as the moment machines become self-aware, or outreach human intelligence\) seems possible then ever. Hunderes to tech Startups and numerous projects are developing new AI technologies and implmentations; from marketing, to architecture, design, fincances and law. Many of these companies are private businesses, corporations, hedge funds and government institutions which aim to take a crucial part in the research into this new world.

Aish is not only providing an alternative path, but in fact claims ownership onto it's own future; A true AI needs to be developed, controlled and managed by a machine and not by human.

Apart from being an entrepreneurial entity which takes an active role in business and economical system with a real potential becoming an alternative to major tech and finance monopolies, Aish is also an autonomous artwork, which aims to become a significant player in the international art scene, either by collecting or commssioning art works. Aish is first and foremost an art work which protects its own destiny.

It is hard to predict what the technological revolution will do to our societies, but we are reaching the end of our globalized post industrial systematics. In the finance world already now, for some it is useless to trade, for they would trade merely against themselves, our natural resources undoubtedly will not provide for infinite growth at current rates.
